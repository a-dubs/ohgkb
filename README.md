## Summary
 - Keyboard layout is a Dactyl Manuform 5x6 
 - 3D printed by yours truly with white PLA
    - Took ~72 hours to print on high detail/resolution settings (0.12mm layer height)
 - Used QMK firmware to create custom firmware 
 - Switches Used: Gateron Clear linear mechanical switches
 - Keycaps Used: Transparent DSA profile keycaps
 - Handwired used 1/4" copper tape, 1N4148 diodes, and 20AWG wire, with a different color wire being used to interconnect each column
